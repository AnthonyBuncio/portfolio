#### Summary

Do you live with friends who never pay their bills? Do your roommates completely ignore all your messages to pay rent? I built Crumb as a way for roommates, or just any group of friends to easily keep track and manage expenses. If they are looking to be more financially responsible, this app is a great way to help them to do just that. Crumb appoints a single person to manage all the expenses within a house/group and issues expenses to those members. Each member has a unique dashboard that contains great visualizations and personalized charts. Easy and intuitive design of this app will finally help you get back in control of your finances!
